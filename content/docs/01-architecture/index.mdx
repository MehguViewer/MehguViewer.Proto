# Architecture

This section details the low-level architectural decisions that power the MehguViewer Federation.

## Key Concepts

### The Trust Model
[**Read More ->**](/docs/01-architecture/02-trust-model)

How Core Nodes verify user identity without a shared database using Public Key Cryptography (JWKS).

### URN Identifiers
[**Read More ->**](/docs/01-architecture/03-urns)

Using Uniform Resource Names (`urn:mvn:...`) for context-aware routing and federation.

### Node Discovery (Coming Soon)
How clients find and connect to different Core Nodes.

### Library Sync (Coming Soon)
How reading progress is synchronized across devices.
