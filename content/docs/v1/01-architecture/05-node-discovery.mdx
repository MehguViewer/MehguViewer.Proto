# Node Discovery

Unlike centralized platforms, MehguViewer does not have a single "home" server. Instead, clients must be told which Core Nodes to connect to. This section outlines the discovery and connection process.

## 1. Manual Connection

The primary method for adding a node is **Manual Entry**. The user provides the base URL of a Core Node they wish to connect to.

-   **Example URL:** `https://core.mehgu.example.com`
-   **User Action:** The user enters this URL into the client's "Add Server" dialog.

## 2. The Well-Known Endpoint

To verify that a URL points to a valid MehguViewer Core Node and to fetch its metadata, the client performs a `GET` request to a standardized discovery endpoint.

**Endpoint:** `/.well-known/mehgu-node`

### Response Format

The node must return a JSON object containing its identity and capabilities.

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "node_name": "Mehgu Official Public Node",
  "description": "The official public access node for MehguViewer.",
  "auth_server": "https://auth.mehgu.example.com",
  "capabilities": {
    "search": true,
    "streaming": true,
    "download": false
  },
  "maintainer": {
    "name": "Admin",
    "email": "admin@example.com"
  }
}
```

### Validation Steps
1.  **Fetch:** Client requests `GET <InputURL>/.well-known/mehgu-node`.
2.  **Parse:** Client parses the JSON response.
3.  **Check Version:** Client ensures the node version is compatible.
4.  **Auth Discovery:** Client notes the `auth_server` URL for future login flows.

## 3. Node Lists (Optional)

While not part of the core protocol, community-maintained "Node Lists" may exist. These are simple JSON files hosted on GitHub or other static sites that list trusted public nodes.

Clients may optionally support importing these lists to populate the server selection screen.
