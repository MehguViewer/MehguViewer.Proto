# Architecture

This section details the low-level architectural decisions that power the MehguViewer Federation.

## Key Concepts

### Security Architecture
[**Read More ->**](/docs/v1/01-architecture/01-security-architecture)

How Core Nodes verify user identity without a shared database using Public Key Cryptography (JWKS).

### URN Identifiers
[**Read More ->**](/docs/v1/01-architecture/02-urns)

Using Uniform Resource Names (`urn:mvn:...`) for context-aware routing and federation.

### Network Policy
[**Read More ->**](/docs/v1/01-architecture/03-network-policy)

Firewall rules and CORS policies for secure federation.

### Node Discovery
[**Read More ->**](/docs/v1/01-architecture/04-node-discovery)

How clients find and connect to different Core Nodes.

### Library Sync
[**Read More ->**](/docs/v1/01-architecture/05-library-sync)
