## 📖 Overview

**MehguViewer.Proto** serves as the **Single Source of Truth** for the MehguViewer Federated Media Ecosystem. It houses the architectural decisions, the OpenAPI specifications for the services, and the user-facing documentation.

This repository is intended to be a **reference implementation**. While the code for the documentation site is open source, the **specifications (OpenAPI)** and **documentation content** represent the official standard and should be treated as the canonical definition of the protocol.

## 🏗 Architecture

The ecosystem is built upon three distinct pillars:

1.  **Auth (Identity Provider)**: Handles OIDC-compliant authentication, global user profiles, and security (blocklists).
2.  **Core (Content Delivery)**: Manages the federation of Manga, Anime, and Novels, along with local social features (comments, votes).
3.  **Web (Client)**: The stateless interface that aggregates data from Auth and Core.
